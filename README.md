To protect an individual's personal information (RA 10173, Data Privacy Act of 2012), only users with an admin account can view the list of individuals who visited the premises.

Frequently used operations (managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users, permissions, etc) can be performed via the user interface, while you still have the ability to directly execute any SQL statement.
