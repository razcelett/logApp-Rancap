<br/>

To protect an individual's personal information (RA 10173, Data Privacy Act of 2012), only users with an admin account can view the list of individuals who visited the premises.

The admin will have the access to *Person's Log* tab and this tab will show the list of individual's who fill out the form. This includes their name, address and logged date and time. <br/><br/>
